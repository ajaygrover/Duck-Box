# Duck-Box


Duck box is a experimental UI for media players.

UI is inspired from microsoft zune. This will initially be a website using Soundcloud API for music (Open for ideas for videos and other form of media). 

It will be using newer technologies such as REACT with MEAN stack. I will be learning to use these technologies in progress. Anychanges to code or suggestion for a better way to do certain things will be highly appreciated.

Thanks
